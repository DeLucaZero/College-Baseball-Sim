Welcome to the College Baseball Sim repository. 

College Baseball Sim is a text based baseball game where Users take control and coach up their college teams to the College World Series. Users will scout, recruit, train, set lineups and strategize with their teams.

This project is written with a PHP and MySQL backend. The front end uses HTML/CSS with JavaScript, JQuery, and Ajax for functionality.

This repo is only for the front-end of the website. I use UserSpice for user management.

If you require any back end scripts, you will need to contact me for the relevent files.

For setup and development you will need a WAMP/LAMP server to run apache and php. In your PHPMyAdmin, you will need to upload the two database files located in the Database directory. the CBS_Main database is for user and website data, whereas CBS is game based data.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
